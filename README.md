# Resume Generator in React!
A resume generator written in react with plans to export to PDF. Yay.

Just execute npm start (after doing an npm install of course) and the website should start right up.

Make sure you update the source.json file in the public/data folder to personalize the layout.

## Notes
- The portfolio field under "personalInfo" in source.json is optional (meaning you can delete it if desired).
- If "endYear" is left null in any experience object in source.json it will be replaced with "Present".

# TO-DO
- Get PDF export working
