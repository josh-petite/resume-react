# resume-react
A resume generator written in react with plans to export to PDF. Yay.

Just execute npm start (after doing an npm install of course) and the website should start right up.

Make sure you update the data function in App.js to generate a new layout.

# TO-DO
- Have data read from an external source (probably JSON file) instead of javascript
- Get PDF export working
